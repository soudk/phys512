This directory contains my project for the PHYS 512 class at McGill. 

This project investigates the flux of muons underground in SNOLAB. A jupyter notebook is written in python to propagate muons through a hypothetical water tank/shield at SNOLAB. There are two main files, one investigates the muon flux separately, and the other utilizes Numba/Parallel to ray trace the Cherenkov photon distribution on the toy water shield. 

For a more detailed outline of the project, context, and explanation of the figures please see the Project Cherenkov Description PDF file.
