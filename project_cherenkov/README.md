This directory contains my project for the PHYS 512 class at McGill. 

It is using python to investigate the flux of muons through a hypothetical water tank/shield at SNOLAB. There are two main version of the code. One tries to use Numba/Parallel computing and the other follows a simpler (slower) approach. 

The Numba notebook will be updated during the week.
